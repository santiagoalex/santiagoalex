# Hi guys

I'm Santiago Sanchez, a front-end developer from colombia that loves learn and share with friends. I like a lot to learn new things about development, work with friends, and if is possible, teach about this, I really belives that one of the best way to learn is teaching, also when you teach you can learn from others, may be some day they can be your teachers, that is the reason why with my friends, [Santiago](https://github.com/slqpez), [Andres](https://github.com/andresqb198) start a community, a secure space from all to all to teach and learn from each other. also an enthusiastic of block-chain technology
